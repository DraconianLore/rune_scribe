## Rune Scribe Familiar

### A simple app to make Dungeon & Dragon players using the custom [Rune Scribe class](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-MOtSwND_AahMtlNSdfD) easier to track

* RoR based backend for the Dungeon Master to manage unlocking structures, player levels, and sending messages to the players.
* React based frontend for players views (Overview, Runes and Structures, Bonus Action runes, tags and notes, rune tracking(WIP), settings)
* Websockets(Actioncable) for realtime notification and update sending
